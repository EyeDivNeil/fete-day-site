        On Friday 15 and Saturday 16 July 2016 Lincoln plays host to two days of outdoor
        arts events to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Working with 
        BBC Radio Lincolnshire we are producing professionally-led mass participation live 
        performances in Lincoln to commemorate the anniversary of the landmark invention 
        of the tank. Alongside the main events there is a programme of heritage talks and 
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The large scale outdoor arts event will be organised by the same team
        behind the award winning Lipdub Lincoln Project of 2013, when BBC Radio Lincolnshire
        brought thousands of participants onto the streets of Lincoln for a highly acclaimed 
        public arts happening. Supported by the BBC, Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

        The project focused on the life and times of Sir Isaac Newton in Grantham
        and South Kesteven, where he was born at Woolsthorpe Manor in 1643. Fascination
        with Sir Isaac Newton spans the world. However while his scientific and 
        mathematical writings are known in depth, some of the history about his life 
        and his times in Lincolnshire lies unexplored in local archives and local places.
        This project was born out of a desire by local people to dig deeper and discover 
        those hidden stories. Supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.
